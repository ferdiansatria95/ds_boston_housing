# ds_Boston_Housing
This is my regression problem project for prediciting house price. 

# Problems to Solve
- Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Algorithms with gradient descent optimization to make optimal model for predicting house prices.
- Performing Feature Importance and Regularization (using ElasticNet for lasso and ridge penalties) to eliminate features which had little or no impact.
- Predicting house prices with our own data.

## Code and Resources Used
 - Python Version: 3.7
 - Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, jcopml
 - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices
