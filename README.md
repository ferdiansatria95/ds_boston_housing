# ds_boston_housing
This is my regression problem project for prediciting house price. 

# 1. Define Problems
- Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Algorithms with gradient descent optimization to make optimal model for predicting house prices.
- Performing Feature Importance and Regularization (using ElasticNet for lasso and ridge penalties) to eliminate features which had little or no impact.

## Code and Resources Used
 - Python Version: 3.7
 - Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, jcopml
 - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices
 - Further Information about jcopml : https://github.com/WiraDKP/supervised_learning

# 2. Dataset Cleaning
The dataset is ready to work from kaggle :)

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysist
